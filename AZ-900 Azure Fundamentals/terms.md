  **What is Azure Batch?**
Azure Batch enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs.

When you're ready to run a job, Batch does the following:

Starts a pool of compute VMs for you.
Installs applications and staging data.
Runs jobs with as many tasks as you have.
Identifies failures.
Requeues work.
Scales down the pool as work completes.
There might be situations in which you need raw computing power or supercomputer-level compute power. Azure provides these capabilities.
